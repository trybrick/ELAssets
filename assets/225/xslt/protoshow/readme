Protoshow is a free and easy to use slideshow for use with the Prototype.js and script.aculo.us javascript libraries.

The script is in final Beta release and is generally suitable for production use (indeed I'm using in several client projects). The script is under active development. Follow @get_dave on Twitter for updates.
