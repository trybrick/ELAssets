<h3>Search Questions</h3>

  <p><a name="3-01"></a><strong>How 
  do I use ucook.com’s search engine?</strong><br/>
  Find recipes with ucook.com by searching multiple criteria including: 
  ingredient combinations, author name, preparation time, ethnic focus, nutritional 
  limits, etc. The result of your search shows a list of matching recipes, the 
  ingredients used in the recipes, the book title and page number where the recipe 
  is found, and a detailed nutritional breakdown of the recipe.
  For information on how to search for recipes, see <a href="SearchTips.cfm">Search 
  Tips</a>.</p>

<a href="#TOP3">Return To FAQ List</a>  </p>
<p><a name="3-02"></a><strong>What 
  are acceptable search entries?</strong><br/>
  You can search for recipes by any of the following criteria: recipe title, 
  cookbook author, ingredient or ingredient combinations, holidays, nutritional 
  preferences, meal course, ethnic or regional heritage, and maximum preparation 
  time. You can search for recipes that require specific cooking equipment, as 
  well as kosher, vegetarian, and vegan recipes. You can also exclude ingredients, 
  ingredient combinations, authors, or other criteria.<br/>
  <a href="#TOP3">Return To FAQ List</a> </p>
<p><a name="3-03"></a><strong>Why 
  do I have to separate search terms with "and" and "or"?</strong><br/>

  Because many foods have compound names, when searching ucook.com the 
  search engine needs to be shown what word or string of words makes up a single 
  food. For instance, rice wine vinegar can be one ingredient, but rice, wine, 
  and vinegar can also be separate ingredients. Without using separators (i.e. 
  rice and wine and vinegar), you would never be able to search for a recipe that 
  included rice wine vinegar as an ingredient – the search engine would look for 
  rice, wine, and vinegar as separate ingredients. For more information on searching, 
  please see <a href="#">Search Tips</a>.<br/>
  <a href="#TOP3">Return To FAQ List</a> <br/>
  <br/>
  <a name="3-04"></a><strong>How can I improve my search for recipes?</strong><br/>
  A recipe search should be quick and easy. Don't be afraid to experiment 
  with ucook.com's search box. </p>

<p>You can enter into the search 
  box any ingredient(s), holiday(s), item(s) represented by the pull-down menus, 
  recipe name(s), author name(s) or a combination thereof. You can also exclude 
  any ingredient(s), author(s), etc. You can narrow your search and get even more 
  targeted results by using the pull-down menus and/or indicating different dietary 
  preferences or cookbooks in conjunction with your search box entries.</p>
<p>Conducting a recipe search 
  by entering basic ingredients into the search box and/or choosing basic selections 
  from the pull-down menus, may produce as many as 50 recipes matching your criteria. 
  In that case, you may want to narrow your search request. To do so, simply hit 
  your browser's back button to return to the ucook.com home page, and adjust 
  your entries accordingly. </p>
<p>Conversely, requesting a 
  complex combination of ingredients along with complex selections from the pull-down 
  menus (for example, a region AND a particular piece of equipment), may produce 
  a result with very few, or even NO matching recipes. In that case, you may want 
  to broaden your search request. To do so, simply hit your back button to return 
  to the home page, and adjust your entries accordingly. </p>
<p>For in-depth guidance, see 
  "search tips," found directly above the search box on the home page, and click 
  on &quot;<a href="#">Using AND, OR and NOT</a>.&quot;<br/>
  <a href="#TOP3">Return To FAQ List</a> </p>
<p><a name="3-05"></a><strong>What 
  is the best way for me to narrow my search by region?</strong><br/>
  Using the regional pull-down menu, found below the search box on the home page, 
  may be the best way to narrow your search, as it represents all the choices 
  currently available to you. Or, you can simply type the country, region or ethnic 
  name of interest into the search box to achieve the same result.<br/>

  <a href="#TOP3">Return To FAQ List</a> </p>
<p><a name="3-06"></a><strong>What 
  happens if I put &quot;French&quot; in the search box?</strong><br/>
  Putting &quot;French&quot; in the search box will turn up French recipes. It 
  will turn up recipes with French-cut green beans, French Fries, and other foods 
  that are not necessarily French, but use that word in their name. If you are 
  actually looking for French recipes, it would be better to choose &quot;French&quot; 
  from the &quot;regional&quot; pull-down menu and then conduct your search.<br/>

  <a href="#TOP3">Return To FAQ List</a> </p>
<p><a name="3-07"></a><strong>Why 
  isn't my homeland represented on your "regional" list?</strong><br/>
  If a region is not represented on the home page, that may mean that currently 
  there are no recipes in our database representative of that region. But rest 
  assured, as soon as we gain access to a recipe from your region of interest, 
  the name of that region will appear in the regional pull-down menu on the home 
  page.<br/>
  <a href="#TOP3">Return To FAQ List</a> </p>
<p><a name="3-08"></a><strong>Is 
  there a regional default?</strong><br/>
  With apologies to most of the world, ucook.com considers the regional default 
  to be &quot;American&quot; or &quot;continental.&quot; If you do not specify 
  an ethnic or regional focus in the search box or pull-down menu, the search 
  engine will return recipe lists that are primarily from cookbooks published 
  in the United States and that do not have a specific regional focus. If you 
  are looking for &quot;American&quot; food, you do not need to enter that in 
  the search box or pull-down menu. You can search for a specific region in the 
  US, such as New England, Southern cooking, however, using the regional pull-down 
  menu. If you do not want the search box to focus on American or any other region, 
  specify &quot;no preference&quot; in the pull-down menu.<br/>

  <a href="#TOP3">Return To FAQ List</a> <br/>
  <br/>
  <a name="3-09"></a><strong>How do I search for holiday recipes?</strong><br/>
  You can search for holiday-specific recipes by entering the name of a holiday, 
  with or without other ingredients, in the search box.<br/>
  <br/>
  We make an attempt to link traditional holiday recipes with their respective 
  holidays only when the author of the cookbook has done so. As a result, a recipe 
  for roast goose from Williams-Sonoma's Thanksgiving &amp; Christmas book may 
  be included in a search that includes the word "Christmas," while a roast goose 
  recipe from another cookbook may not be included. <br/>

<h3>Recipe Specific &amp; Nutritional Info. Questions</h3>
  <p><a name="4-01"></a><strong>How 
  is a recipe's nutritional value determined?</strong><br/>
  Recipes contained in the ucook.com database are broken down into their 
  smallest components. Recipe ingredients are compared with nutritional information 
  from the USDA nutritional database and other sources, and are calculated according 
  to their volume in the recipe. Then, that information is divided by the number 
  of servings that the recipe makes, resulting in the nutritional value of a single 
  serving of the dish.<br/>

  <a href="#TOP4">Return To FAQ List</a> </p>
<p><a name="4-02"></a><strong>How 
  accurate is your nutritional information?</strong><br/>
  ucook.com includes the most comprehensive nutritional information available 
  anywhere. Labeling laws in the United States allow food product manufacturers 
  to have a margin of error of as much as 20 percent on product labels. We are 
  confident that our nutritional calculations are at least this accurate and, 
  in most cases, more.</p>
<p>Nutritional data for a specific 
  ingredient is not calculated in a recipe’s overall per serving value under the 
  following conditions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>When the ingredient is 
    not preceded by a measure or an amount (i.e. 1 cup, 5 tablespoons, 10 pieces)</li>
  <li> When the ingredient 
    is listed as optional or as a variation </li>

  <li>When the ingredient is 
    too unique to be matched to a food in the USDA database or other food nutrition 
    source. (The accuracy of recipe’s nutritional value will decrease if the ingredient 
    is uncommon but has been closely matched to a similar food in the USDA database 
    or other food nutrition source.)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#TOP4">Return To 
  FAQ List</a>  </p>
<p><a name="4-03"></a><strong>How 
  do I choose "my recipes?"</strong><br/>
  Whenever you select recipes, they are stored for you in a personal database 
  on ucook.com. Clicking on "<a href="#">my 
  recipes</a>," found below the search box, shows you a listing of all the recipes 
  you have previously selected. </p>
<p>If you have selected a large 
  quantity of recipes, you may eventually want the ucook.com search engine 
  to search your personal collection of previously selected recipes. To do so, 
  follow these steps: </p>

<ul>
  <ol>
    <li> Click on the box beside 
      the line reading "search only my recipes."</li>
    <li>Choose your ingredients 
      and/or search criteria from the pull-down menus found below the search box.</li>
    <li>Then click on the &quot;search&quot; 
      button. </li>

  do I set my diet preferences?</strong><br/>
  To set your diet preferences, click on "<a href="#">my diet preferences</a>," 
  found below the search box on the home page. When the diet preferences page 
  appears you may choose and save your preferences for the remainder of the visit 
  or mark them as defaults for future visits.</p>
<p>To save for your current 
  visit, follow these steps: </p>
<ul>
  <ol>

    <li>Make your selections 
      from the available choices and pull-down menus. Do not click on any boxes 
      found under the heading "save as default."</li>
    <li>If you wish to exclude 
      certain foods or whole categories of food, such as dairy, enter that preference 
      in the box labeled &quot;always exclude.&quot;</li>
    <li>Click on the "save 
      preferences" button.</li>
    <li>When the next page 
      appears, confirm your selections then click on "home," found at the bottom 
      of that page.</li>

<p><a name="4-06"></a><strong>Why 
  would I ignore my diet preferences?</strong><br/>
  Even if you are very consistent in your own diet, there may be times when you 
  wish to override the diet preferences you have set as defaults. You may wish 
  to do this, for example, when you are cooking for others. </p>
<p>In those cases, place a 
  checkmark in the box (by clicking on it) beside "ignore my diet preferences," 
  found under the search box on the home page. Your diet preferences will be ignored 
  as long as that box is checked.<br/>

<p><a name="4-07"></a><strong>What 
  constitutes a vegetarian recipe?</strong><br/>
  A vegetarian diet excludes all meat including fish and poultry.<br/>
  <a href="#TOP4">Return To FAQ List</a> </p>

<p><a name="4-08"></a><strong>What 
  constitutes a vegan recipe?</strong><br/>
  A vegan diet excludes all meat including fish and poultry, animal by-products, 
  and all dairy products (including butter, cheese, eggs and milk).<br/>
  <a href="#TOP4">Return To FAQ List</a> <br/>

  </p>
<p><a name="4-09"></a><strong>What 
  constitutes a kosher food?</strong><br/>
  A kosher diet involves preparing and eating foods according to strict Jewish 
  biblical laws. These laws are complex, and we are not experts on the subject. 
  However, we have done our homework and consult with an Orthodox Rabbi when questions 
  arise. </p>
<p>We have categorized foods 
  into four groups: kosher dairy, kosher fish, kosher meat and pareve (food made 
  without animal or dairy ingredients). In accordance with Jewish dietary rules, 
  however, some foods, including some dairy, fish and meat, will never be considered 
  kosher. </p>
<p>While attributing recipes, 
  we considered whether or not a particular product could be bought at a supermarket 
  with a rabbinical seal of approval. For example, when attributing a recipe for 
  pizza, we would consider that although that recipe may not explicitly call for 
  kosher cheese, the cook preparing the recipe would choose to use a kosher cheese.<br/>
  <a href="#TOP4">Return To FAQ List</a> </p>

<p><a name="4-10"></a><strong>How 
  are courses determined?</strong><br/>

  The process of determining what courses are appropriate for any given recipe 
  is not particularly scientific. Whenever provided, we follow the guidance of 
  the cookbook author regarding the course for which a recipe is most appropriate. 
  However, when the author has not offered guidance, our food-savvy staff categorizes 
  the recipe as one or more of the course options available on the course pull-down 
  menu found below the search box on the ucook.com home page. <br/>
  <a href="#TOP4">Return To FAQ List</a> <br/>
  <br/>

  <a name="4-11"></a><strong>How is a recipe's preparation time determined?</strong><br/>
  When a cookbook author provides a preparation time for his or her recipes, we 
  present that time to you. However, when the author has not provided a preparation 
  time, our staff of professionally trained chefs, cooking school graduates and 
  teachers, avid cooks and new cooks offers an estimate of the time it is likely 
  to take the "average home cook" to prepare that recipe.</p>
<p>These are the guidelines 
  we use to help us estimate preparation times: </p>

<ul>
  <ol>
    <li>If the recipe calls 
      for the cook to chop, dice, cut, shred, grate, etc., we factor in the time 
      it takes to complete the task.</li>
    <li>If the recipe calls 
      for pre-prepared ingredients such as cooked chicken, cooked pasta, baked 
      potato, etc., we do not factor in the time it takes to complete the task.<br/>
      (Example: 2 cups cooked chicken breast, diced - In this case, we would not 
      factor in the time it takes to cook the chicken, but would factor in the 
      time it takes to dice the chicken.) </li>

<h3>Other Questions</h3>
<p><a name="5-01"></a><strong>How 
  do I purchase a cookbook?</strong><br/>
  There are a few ways to begin the cookbook purchase process. They are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By clicking on a cookbook 
    title that appears as a hyperlink (usually in blue)</li>
  <li>By clicking on &quot;about 
    this book/purchase information&quot;</li>
  <li>By clicking on &quot;purchase 
    this book&quot;</li>

</ul>
<p>Once you have clicked on 
  one of the above screen prompts, you will be taken directly to ucook.com's 
  book seller vendor of choice where you can proceed with the purchasing process. 
  <i>*Note, this cookbook purchase option may or may not be available depending 
  on the website's preferences</i>.<br/>

  <a name="5-02"></a><strong>Why doesn’t the list of equipment contain all kitchen 
  tools?</strong><br/>
  The equipment listed in the equipment pull-down menu is not meant to be an exhaustive 
  list of all the tools likely to be found in the well-stocked kitchen. </p>

<p>Although you seldom decide 
  to prepare a meal based on the equipment you want to cook with, there may be 
  times when a piece of equipment dictates your recipe choice. For instance, it 
  is very likely that a new bread machine owner will want to search for bread 
  machine recipes. <br/>
